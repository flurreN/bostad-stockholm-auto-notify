# bostad-stockholm-auto-notify

## What is this project doing?

This project is a web scraper that extracts information about apartments from https://bostad.stockholm.se and sends notifications to a Discord webhook when a new apartment matching specified filters is found. The code uses the Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries to navigate the website and extract relevant information. The apartment data is then stored in a free Firestore database to keep track of what has been posted to Discord.
