# bostad-stockholm-auto-notify

## What is this code doing?

This code is a web scraper that extracts information about apartments from https://bostad.stockholm.se. It keeps track of the data stored in the database to determine what to send to a Discord webhook as a notification when a new apartment matching specified filters is found.

The code uses the Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries to navigate the website and extract relevant information. The apartment data is stored in the Firebase database.

## Prerequisites

To use this code, you will need the following:

- A Discord webhook URL. You can create a webhook in your Discord server settings.
- A Firebase Firestore database with credentials stored as a joined line json string.

If you are running this code in a GitHub Action, you will need to set `FIREBASE_ACCOUNT` and `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` as GitHub secrets.

## Inputs

- `FIREBASE_ACCOUNT`: JSON String of Firebase account credentials
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`: Discord webhook url
- `INPUT_APARTMENTS_URL` (OPTIONAL): The URL of the apartment listing website to scrape.Defaults to `https://bostad.stockholm.se/bostad/?sort=annonserad-fran-desc&ungdom=1` if the `APARTMENTS_URL` environment variable is not set.
- `INPUT_APARTMENTS_FILTER` (OPTIONAL): A dictionary of filters to apply to the apartment listings. Defaults to `None` if the `APARTMENTS_FILTER` environment variable is not set or is not a valid JSON object.
  Example value: `{"youth": true, "age": "23"}`. Full list of available filter values.
